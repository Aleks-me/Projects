# Building crime database using PostgreSQL

I've made this project to learn how database could be built with PostgreSQL.

Thanks Dataquest.io for providing "boston.csv" file.


## Getting Started

Run 'Building_crime_database_postgresql.ipynb' to check what's inside.


### Prerequisites

Jupyter Notebook must be installed in order to open .ipynb files.
All required packages listed in 'requirements.txt'.

```
In general you need only two packages:
* Jupyter Notebook
* Psycopg2

```
